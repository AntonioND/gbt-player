Introduction
------------

**GBT Player** is a music creation environment for GB and GBC. It is composed by
**mod2gbt**, which converts a mod file into a gbt (GameBoy Tracker) file, and
GBT Player, which will be used to play that song in the GB. It's the same idea
as the old Lemon player, but greatly improved. Because of this workflow, there
are a lot of limitations that the GB doesn't impose, but that are needed so that
the mod file and the result on the GB are similar.

``GBT Player`` is writen in 100% assembly. That means that it is fast, it won't
need a lot of CPU time (around 7%?), and you will have a lot of time for your
game logic. There is source code for **RGBDS**, the main option for Game Boy
development (in my opinion). There is also legacy code for an old version that
also supported **GBDK**, but it's mostly unmaintained.

``mod2gbt`` is writen in C, and should compile anywhere.

GBT Player is open source, and it is licensed under the BSD license. That means
that you can use and modify it but you have to give credit for the original
work. It would be nice to you tell me if you use it, anyway. :)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Version 1.x.x converted songs won't work with player version
2.0.0 or higher. The same happens with 2.x.x and version 3.0.0.  They have to be
converted again.

How to compile the example
--------------------------

Compile ``mod2gbt``. In Windows you can use a command line like:

``gcc -o mod2gbt.exe mod2gbt``

A Makefile for Linux has been included in case you are feeling lazy. Just do:

``make``

Put ``rgbasm``, ``rgbfix`` and ``rgblink`` in the ``gbt-player`` folder and
run the bat/sh file in the ``rbgds_example`` folder. A compiled GB binary is
included.

Notes
-----

A nice tracker to modify the mod file is **OpenMPT**. You can download it here:

http://openmpt.org/

I don't use bat or sh files in my projects, I use makefiles, but I thought that
the examples would be too simple for a makefile to be useful.

``instr_test.gb`` is a sample of the default sounds.

``range_test.gb`` is just a test of what notes the GB can reach (C3 - B8).

``effects_test.gb`` tests arpeggio and "cut note" effects.

The mod file isn't 100% accurate. Sounds are a bit different from the real ones,
so you should make roms and test them in emulators or real GB often.

When creating **really** big ROMs (more than 4 MiB), the define
``GBT_USE_MBC5_512BANKS`` in ``gbt_player.inc`` should be uncommented to allow
allocation of the music data in banks higher than 255. Also, songs must be
converted adding ``-512-banks`` to the ``mod2gbt`` command line.

If you don't like the speed convertion done by ``mod2gbt`` (from 50 Hz to 60 Hz)
you can use the ``-speed`` argument for ``mod2gbt``. The speed will be higher
and it will probably have to be adjusted manually.

The initial speed of the song is set by the start function, and it will run at
that speed until it finds a change speed command in the song. If the first step
of your song takes forever, this is the reason.

GBDK notes
----------

GBDK: http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/

``GBDK`` default assembler (``as-gbz80``) is no longer supported. ``RGBDS`` must
be used, and I don't really know if ``GBDK`` will work with latest ``RGBDS``
version. Adding ``-W--asm=rgbds`` to the command line when compiling ``GBDK``
code should make it work, but it hasn't been tested.

Since new functionality needs advanced macros like ``BANK()``, which are only
supported by ``RGBDS``, the ``GBDK`` version is discontinued. The latest version
that can be used with ``GBDK`` default assembler (2.1.2) is in the folder
``legacy_gbdk``, as well as the corresponding converter. I don't really know if
the same effect can be obtained with ``as-gbz80``. If it can be done, open an
issue and I may update ``GBDK`` version again. For now, this old legacy version
is mostly unmaintained.

This is an article I wrote related to bank switching:

http://www.skylyrac.net/2015-04-08-gbt-player-usage.html

To compile the ``GBDK`` example: Open the bat file, change it to set the correct
path to your ``lcc`` binary and double clic the bat.

Changelog
---------

- Version 3.0.8 and 2.1.3 (2020/4/21)

  - Fix effect ``Dnn`` in the last pattern of a song (Nolan Baker). Now it jumps
    to pattern 0 instead of crashing.
  - Relicense under the MIT license (rather than BSD-2-Clause).

- Version 3.0.7 (2019/6/3)

  - Fix panning in channel 4.

- Version 3.0.6 (2018/1/20)

  - Code cleanup.
  - Fix example code.
  - Increase version of ``mod2gbt`` to v3.1.
  - Some C fixes (Zalo)

- Version 2.1.2 (2018/1/20)

  - Cleanup of legacy version.
  - ``mod2gbt`` can no longer output assembly files. Set version number to v2.2.
  - Added license headers to all files so that it is easier to bundle code with
    other projects.

- Version 3.0.5 (2016/5/2)

  - Bit shift optimizations.

- Version 3.0.4 (2016/4/5)

  - Code reorganized and added license notices to source files.

- Version 3.0.3 (2016/2/6)

  - Code reorganized to fit in 80 columns.

- Version 3.0.2 (2015/5/3)

  - Corrected tabulations in RGBDS code.

- Version 3.0.1 (2015/4/27)
  - Replaced tabs by spaces in asm code.

- Version 3.0.0 (2015/4/22)

  - Added support for multiple bank songs.
  - ``GBDK`` default assembler (``as-gbz80``) version discontinued. Version
    2.1.1 will be kept in case someone wants to use it.
  - Previously converted songs must be converted again.
  - ``gbt_play()``: registers used for arguments have changed a bit.

- Version 2.1.1 (2015/4/7)

  - Simplified ``GBDK`` example because it was confusing a lot of people...

- Version 2.1.0 (2014/5/24)

  - Fixed arpeggio effect. Now it keeps looping until tick = 0 (previously it
    only looped once). It loops 3 steps, not 4.
  - Added "Cut Note" effect.
  - Effects optimizations.

- Version 2.0.1 (2014/5/23)

  - Fixed effects in channels 1, 2 and 3 in GBDK version.

- Version 2.0.0 (2014/5/22)

  - Rewritten library and converter.
  - Arpeggio effect added.
  - Song size should be reduced to about 60-75% (but it can go as high as 150%
    if it uses effects all time in all channels).
  - Old converted song data won't work, songs have to be converted again.

- Version 1.2.1 (2014/5/15)

  - Fixed ``Bnn`` command.

- Version 1.2 (2014/5/1)

  - Fixed lots of things regarding the mod file template and ``mod2gbt``, the
    converter. Old songs won't be converted right with this new version. You
    should copy pattern data into the new mod template and transpose it 17
    semitones to make it work again.
  - Fixed a typo in a variable name.

- Version 1.1 (2013)

  - Fixed definitions for enabling and disabling channels.
  - Changed email address.

- Version 1.0 (2009)

  - Initial release

To Do
-----

- Store channel 3 samples in RAM to be able to change them in execution time by
  the user?
- End song callback? Special effect for callback? To synchronize game events or
  things like that.
- ``WLA-DX`` version.

Known bugs
----------

- Effect ``Dxx``, when used the last step of a pattern, will jump 2 patterns
  instead of 1.
