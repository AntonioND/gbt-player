GBT Player
==========

Music player library and converter kit for Game Boy and Game Boy Color that can
be used with `RGBDS <https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds>`__ (and, with
limitations, with GBDK). It is also available for Game Boy Advance as a C
library.

Introduction
------------

**GBT Player** is a music creation environment for GB, GBC and GBA. It is formed
by:

- **mod2gbt**: Converts MOD files into GBT (GameBoy Tracker) format.
- **s3m2gbt**: Converts S3M files into GBT (GameBoy Tracker) format.
- **GBT Player**: Library to play GBT format on GB, GBC or GBA.

It's the same idea as the old Lemon player for Game Boy, but greatly improved.
Because of this workflow, there are a lot of limitations that the GB/GBA
doesn't impose, but that are needed so that the mod file and the result on the
GB/GBA are similar.

As of version 4.0.0 there is a big split between the GB/GBC version and the GBA
version.

- For GB/GBC, there is source code for **RGBDS**, the main option for Game Boy
  development (in my opinion). There is also legacy code for an old version that
  also supported **GBDK**, but it's mostly unmaintained. Note that there is no
  S3M support for GB/GBC, only for GBA.

- For GBA, the code is just in C, and it doesn't depend on any library apart from
  a few standard library headers.

GBT Player is open source, and it is licensed under the MIT license. That means
that you can use and modify it but you have to give credit for the original
work. It would be nice to you tell me if you use it, anyway. :)

- Version 2.0.0 (2014/5/22)

  - Rewritten library and converter.
  - Arpeggio effect added.
  - Song size should be reduced to about 60-75% (but it can go as high as 150%
    if it uses effects all time in all channels).

  - Fixed ``Bnn`` command.

- Version 1.2 (2014/5/1)

  - Fixed lots of things regarding the mod file template and ``mod2gbt``, the
    converter. Old songs won't be converted right with this new version. You
    should copy pattern data into the new mod template and transpose it 17
    semitones to make it work again.
  - Fixed a typo in a variable name.

- Version 1.1 (2013)

  - Fixed definitions for enabling and disabling channels.
  - Changed email address.
