GBT Player v4.3.0
=================

Music player library and converter kit for Game Boy Advance. It only uses the
PSG music channels, so the CPU usage is nearly 0%, but all sounds that can be
used are the ones you would expect from a Game Boy or Game Boy Color.

This is very different from other music players for the GBA like
`Maxmod <https://maxmod.devkitpro.org/>`__, which only uses the DMA music
channels. This causes it to use a lot of CPU, but it can play any sounds without
restrictions.

It is possible to use both libraries at the same time, if you want. GBT Player
only uses the hardware registers associated to the PSG channels, leaving the DMA
channels untouched and available for the user.

How to compile the example
--------------------------

First, install `devkitPro <https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started>`__. This
is needed to build ROMs. Once it's installed you can continue.

The following will convert a S3M file called ``template.s3m`` into the right
format and build a sample ROM:

1. Open a terminal

2. Go to the ``example`` folder.

3. Run ``sh make_rom.sh`` on your terminal.

Legacy songs in MOD format
--------------------------

You can also use MOD files instead of S3M, but it is highly discouraged. This
should only be done if you are using songs that were already in MOD format and
don't want to convert them to S3M. You will need to use ``mod2gbt`` instead of
``s3m2gbt``.

This converter tries to imitate bugs present in v3.X (like incorrect volume
handling when a note is set but no volume is set).

Note that ``mod2gbt`` will never support any new feature as it could potentially
break compatibility with old songs. If you want to keep working on a song and
use any of the new features present in ``s3m2gbt``, you can easily convert your
songs with tools like OpenMPT.

Notes
-----

A nice tracker to modify the mod file is **OpenMPT**. You can download it here:

http://openmpt.org/

- ``instr_test.gb`` is a sample of the default sounds.

- ``range_test.gb`` is just a test of what notes the GB can reach (C3 - B8).

- ``effects_test.gb`` tests arpeggio and "cut note" effects.

- ``volume_slide_test.gb`` tests the volume slide effects.

- ``volume_test.gb`` tests the range of volumes supported by each channel.

The MOD and S3M files aren't 100% accurate. Sounds are a bit different from the
real ones, so you should make ROMs and test them in emulators or real GBAs
often.
