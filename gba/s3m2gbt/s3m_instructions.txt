                       INITIAL STATUS
                       --------------

You can set the global song speed in the song settings, as well as the initial
panning for each channel. It isn't needed to set them by using them as effects.

Don't change the BPM of the song, it's set so that it matches the refresh
frequency of the GB/GBC/GBA.

The converter ignores global volumes, as well as sample volumes. The only
volumes used are the ones in the patterns.

                         FREQUENCIES
                         -----------

You can use notes from C3 to B8.

^^ note cuts are supported.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| CHANNEL | RANGE |                      NOTES                        |
+---------+-------+---------------------------------------------------+
|    1    |  1-4  |                                                   |
|    2    |  1-4  |                                                   |
|    3    |  8-15 | Volume is usually a bit lower than other channels.|
|    4    | 16-31 | Doesn't change with frequency (always C5).        |
+---------+-------+---------------------------------------------------+

Volume of channel 3 is always lower than other channels because the waveform of
channels 1, 2 and 4 use the full range of allowed values (0% or 100%) but
channel 3 can be set to any value in between. The area of any waveform of
channel 3 will always be smaller than the other channels (unless the wave of
channel 3 is a square wave).

                           EFFECTS
                           -------

Ann - Sets speed to nn (in hexadecimal). Valid values 01h and higher.
      The higher the value, the slower the song.

Bnn - Jump to pattern in order nn (in hexadecimal).

Cnn - Ends this pattern and jumps to position nn (in decimal) in next pattern.
      If used the last step of a pattern it will jump two patterns, not one!

Dxy - Volume slide. Only channels 1, 2, and 4.

      Notes:

      - The PSG channels can't stop the volume slide after it has started. You
        need to either set a new volume manually, or wait until it goes to the
        minimum or maximum volume.

      - This means that after the first Dxy effect you should add D00 effects in
        your pattern until the note is silent. The effects are ignored on the
        GBA, but they are needed so that the S3M playback matches the GBA
        playback. Don't repeat the original Dxy effect! It would sound ok in the
        S3M player, but in the GBA it wouldn't work.

                 OK       |      Not OK

            C3 01 v64 D06 |  C3 01 v64 D06
                      D00 |            D06
                      D00 |            D06
            C4 01 v64 --- |  C4 01 v64 ---

      - Only values 1-7 are allowed. (D10 to D70 and D01 to D07). This is
        because the hardware volume slide of the PSG channels only has 7
        different speeds. Software volume slides create a lot of clicks, so they
        sound terrible, and can't be used as an alternative.

      - Fine volume slide is not allowed (DFy or DxF).

Hxy - Vibrato. Only channels 1, 2 and 3.

Jxy - Arpeggio. Only channels 1, 2 and 3.

Cnn - Sets the volume to nn (in hexadecimal). Valid values from 00h to 40h.
      Channel 3 can only be set to 0%, 25%, 50% and 100%. Others can be set
      in a range of 0-Fh. On GBA, channel 3 can also be set to 75%.

S8n - Sets the panning to n (in hexadecimal).
      Left --- Both --- Right
      0123   456789AB    CDEF

SCn - Cut Note after n ticks. If n > speed or n = 0, it won't work.
