; - If the following value is uncomented, the total of banks allowed is 512
;   (or more), but it's a bit slower. MBC5 ONLY, DOESN'T WORK WITH OTHERS!!!
;   YOU MUST USE THE -512-banks OPTION WHEN CONVERTING A SONG WITH mod2gbt!!!
; - If it's commented, only 256 banks are allowed, it's a little bit faster
;   and saves a few bytes. MBC1, MBC3 and MBC5 (and others).
